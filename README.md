# Neural Progenitor Cells for Spinal Cord Injury

## Cytokine and chemokine expression in the cerbrospinal fluid

**Aim:** This part of the project aims at identifying how the transplanted neural progenitor cells (NPCs) affect the inflammatory response following spinal cord injury (SCI).

**Study design:** Animals received a 200 kdyn SCI and transplantation of GFP+NPCs 8-10 days post SCI. Animals were sacrificed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected at 2, 5 and 12 weeks post SCI.
